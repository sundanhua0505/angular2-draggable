draggable.\n\nOnline Demo\nOnline Docs\n\nTable of contents\n\nGetting Started\nInstallation\nUsage\nAPI\nEvents\n\nGetting Started\nangular2-draggable is an angular (ver >= 4.x) directive that makes the DOM element draggable. (Note that: It's different from drag-and-drop)\nLatest Update\n\n2018.05.23: 1.4.2\n\nChanges: expose boundsCheck() method.\n\n\n2018.05.11: 1.4.1\n\nBugfix: Handle Drag is not working in Firefox #68.\n\n\n2018.05.04: 1.4.0\n\nProvide [gridSize] option for snapping to grid. Refer to demo. (PR #64 by PAHADIx)\nCode optimized. (PR #60 by korn3l)\n\n\n2018.04.10: 1.3.2\n\nProvide [outOfBounds] option. Set it to allow element get out of bounds from the direction. Refer to demo. (PR #57 by waldo2188)\n\n\n2018.03.15: 1.3.1\n\nProvide (movingOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when moving\nProvide (endOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when stop moving\n\n\n2018.03.09: 1.3.0\n\nProvide [position] option: to set current position offset.\n\n\n2018.02.08: 1.2.1\n\nBugfix: [preventDefaultEvent] should not prevent events of elements outside the handle.\n\n\n2018.02.07: 1.2.0\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: use Renderer2 of angular-core. So we don't support angular version \nProvide: resetPosition() method to reset position. Refer to demo for details.\nBugfix: [trackPosition] was not working as expected.\nChange: The directive now exportAs: 'ngDraggable'. For example we can use  to assign this directive to a variable.\nChange: [preventDefaultEvent] set default to false.\n\n\n2018.02.01: 1.1.0\n\nProvide [trackPosition] option: whether to track the element's movement. (PR by Blackbaud-MikitaYankouski)\nProvide [scale] option: to fix scaling issue #31\nProvide [preventDefaultEvent] option: whether to prevent default mouse or touch event. (default: true)\n\n\n2017.12.20: 1.1.0-beta.0\n\nProvide [zIndex] and [zIndexMoving] to control z-index property.\nProvide [bounds], (edge) and [inBounds] to do boundary check and limit element staying in the bounds.\nUpdate demo page.\n\n\n\n\n2017.09.19: Fix an issue when dragging with touch.\n\n2017.08.26: Fix an issue: clicking before dragging leading to unexpected offset (PR #12 by bmartinson13)\n\n2017.07.24: Fix cross-browser compatibility issues.\n\n2017.07.05: Publish UMD bundle\n\n\nInstallation\nnpm install angular2-draggable --saveHow to use it with:\n\nSystemJS: For example: angular quickstart. You need to modify systemjs.config.js file just like:\n\n{\n  map: {\n    // ...\n\n    // angular2-draggable\n    'angular2-draggable':                   'npm:angular2-draggable',\n  },\n  packages: {\n    // other packages ...\n\n    //angular2-draggable\n    'angular2-draggable': {\n      defaultExtension: 'js',\n      main: 'bundles/angular2-draggable.umd.min.js'\n    }\n  }\n}Usage\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import AngularDraggableModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\n import { AngularDraggableModule } from 'angular2-draggable';\n\n @NgModule({\n   imports: [\n     ...,\n     AngularDraggableModule\n   ],\n   ...\n })\n export class AppModule { }\nThen: use ngDraggable directive to make the DOM element draggable.\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:Drag me!\n\n\nUse [handle] to move parent element:\n\nhtml:\nI'm handle. Drag me!\nYou can't drag this block now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\nDirective:\nngDraggable directive support following input porperties:\n\nngDraggable: boolean. You can toggle the draggable capability by setting true/false to ngDraggable\n\nhandle: HTMLElement. Use template variable to refer to the handle element. Then only the handle element is draggable.\n\nzIndex: string. Use it to set z-index property when element is not moving.\n\nzIndexMoving: string. Use it to set z-index property when element is moving.\n\nbounds: HTMLElemnt. Use it to set the boundary.\n\ninBounds: boolean, default is false. Use it make element stay in the bounds.\n\noutOfBounds: { top: boolean; bottom: boolean; right: boolean; left: boolean }, default are false. Set it to allow element get out of bounds from the direction. Refer to demo\n\nposition: IPosition: { x: number, y: number }, default is { x:0, y:0 }. Use it to set initial position offset.\n\ngridSize: number, default is 1. Use it for snapping to grid. Refer to demo.\n\n\nCSS:\nWhen ngDraggable is enabled on some element, ng-draggable class is automatically assigned to it. You can use it to customize the pointer style. For example:\n.ng-draggable {\n  cursor: move;\n}Events\n\nSupport started and stopped events. The nativeElement of the host would be emitted.\nSupport edge events only when [bounds] is set. It would emit the result of the boundary check.\n(movingOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when moving\n(endOffset) event emitter: emit position offset when stop moving\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:\nDrag me!\n\n\n\n\nDemo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
